My research revolves around understanding molecular mechanisms that control axon growth, with the ultimate goal of using this information to induce axon regeneration following injury. I have spent the last decade tackling the problem of why injured neurons in the central nervous system fail to upregulate the right sets of genes supportive of axon re-growth, which ultimately determines regenerative success. I have identified and addressed transcriptional and epigenetic barriers to re-growth using a combination of methods including Bioinformatics, Functional Genomics, and High-Content Screening. I am currently looking to transition to a tenure track position in India in the coming year.
