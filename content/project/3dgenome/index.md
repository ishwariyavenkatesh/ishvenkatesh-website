title: "3D genome topology in the context of axon regeneration"
summary: "Transcription factor activity is intricately linked to the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Transcription factors can directly bind to promoters to activate gene expression. However, the maximal transcriptional output is achieved when TFs bind distal regulatory regions called enhancers, and 3D looping of DNA brings an enhancer into physical proximity with a promoter. In recent years, several studies have documented the importance of optimal 3D genome architecture in regulating multiple biological processes from stem cell biology, cell differentiation, organ development, etc via modulation of TF activity. We have isolated regulatory elements that maintain optimal 3D genome architecture supportive of developmental axon growth and are currently investigating the influence of 3D genome topology in the context of regeneration."
