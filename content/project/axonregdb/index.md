title: "Open-access regulatory genomics database"
summary: "Mammalian CNS neurons arenâ€™t always refractory to re-growth, instead lose the ability in a discrete developmental transition. Identifying the molecular regulatory codes that control this developmental transition is the first-step in devising strategies to reprogram adult neurons back to a growth-competent state. Projects like the ENCODE consortia have generated several brain-specific genomics datasets that comprehensively profile various molecular changes across neuronal maturation. Yet, accessing, integrating and visualizing these datasets require computational expertise. We have developed an open-access, interactive website that allows users to probe temporal patterns of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, functional enhancers and transcription factor binding across mouse forebrain development accessible at [mousebraindev.com](https://www.mousebraindev.com)"
