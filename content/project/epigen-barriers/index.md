title: "Epigenetic barriers to axon re-growth"
summary: "A fundamental barrier to axon re-growth is chromatin accessibility. We and others have shown that as neurons mature, growth-relevant genes shift to a closed conformation limiting transcription factor binding and re-growth response. Reversing this epigenetic constraint is key to full efficacy of gene treatments. Using bioinformatics modeling, we have identified a targeted set of chromatin modifiers predicted to revert accessibility of growth genes to a more open conformation in adult neurons, and are currently screening candidates in functional assays."
