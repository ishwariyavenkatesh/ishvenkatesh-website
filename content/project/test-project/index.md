title: " Transcriptional barriers to regrowth"
summary: "Successful axon re-growth and the capacity of an injured neuron to reboot transcriptional growth machinery is closely linked. We have identified two key transcriptional barriers to re-growth (1) Lack of activating transcription factors to reactivate growth networks following injury (2) Presence of repressive transcription factors that prevent reactivation of growth networks following injury. Using a hybrid bioinformatics/functional screening strategy, we continue to make progress in mitigating these barriers."
