 abstract = {Neurons in the embryonic and
peripheral nervous system respond to injury by activating
transcriptional programs supportive of axon growth, ultimately
resulting in functional recovery. In contrast, neurons in the
adult central nervous system (CNS) possess a limited capacity to
regenerate axons after injury, fundamentally constraining repair.
Activating pro-regenerative gene expression in CNS neurons is a
promising therapeutic approach, but progress is hampered by
incomplete knowledge of the relevant transcription factors. An
emerging hypothesis is that factors implicated in cellular growth
and motility outside the nervous system may also control axon
growth in neurons. We therefore tested sixty-nine transcription
factors, previously identified as possessing tumor suppressive or
oncogenic properties in non-neuronal cells, in assays of neurite
outgrowth. This screen identified YAP1 and E2F1 as enhancers of
neurite outgrowth, and PITX1, RBM14, ZBTB16, and HHEX as
inhibitors. Follow-up experiments are focused on the tumor
suppressor HHEX, one of the strongest growth inhibitors. HHEX is
widely expressed in adult CNS neurons, including corticospinal
tract neurons after spinal injury, but is present only in trace
amounts in immature cortical neurons and adult peripheral
neurons. HHEX overexpression in early postnatal cortical neurons
reduced both initial axonogenesis and the rate of axon
elongation, and domain deletion analysis strongly implicated
transcriptional repression as the underlying mechanism. These
findings suggest a role for HHEX in restricting axon growth in
the developing CNS, and substantiate the hypothesis that
previously identified oncogenes and tumor suppressors can play
conserved roles in axon extension.},
