 abstract = {Axon regeneration in adult central
nervous system (CNS) is limited in part by a developmental
decline in the ability of injured neurons to re-express needed
regeneration associated genes (RAGs). Adult CNS neurons may lack
appropriate pro-regenerative transcription factors, or may
display chromatin structure that restricts transcriptional access
to RAGs. Here we performed epigenetic profiling around the
promoter regions of key RAGs, and found progressive restriction
across a time course of cortical maturation. These data identify
a potential intrinsic constraint to axon growth in adult CNS
neurons. Neurite outgrowth from cultured postnatal cortical
neurons, however, proved insensitive to treatments that improve
axon growth in other cell types, including combinatorial
overexpression of AP1 factors, overexpression of histone
acetyltransferases, and pharmacological inhibitors of histone
deacetylases. This insensitivity could be due to intermediate
chromatin closure at the time of culture, and highlights
important differences in cell culture models used to test
potential pro-regenerative interventions.},
