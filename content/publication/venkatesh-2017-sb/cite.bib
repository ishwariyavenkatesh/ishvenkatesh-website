 abstract = {Recovery from injuries to the central nervous system, including
spinal cord injury, is constrained in part by the intrinsically
low ability of many CNS neurons to mount an effective
regenerative growth response. To improve outcomes, it is
essential to understand and ultimately reverse these
neuron-intrinsic constraints. Genetic manipulation of key
transcription factors (TFs), which act to orchestrate production
of multiple regeneration-associated genes, has emerged as a
promising strategy. It is likely that no single TF will be
sufficient to fully restore neuron-intrinsic growth potential,
and that multiple, functionally interacting factors will be
needed. An extensive literature, mostly from non-neural cell
types, has identified potential mechanisms by which TFs can
functionally synergize. Here we examine four potential mechanisms
of TF/TF interaction; physical interaction, transcriptional
cross-regulation, signaling-based cross regulation, and
co-occupancy of regulatory DNA. For each mechanism, we consider
how existing knowledge can be used to guide the discovery and
effective use of TF combinations in the context of regenerative
neuroscience. This mechanistic insight into TF interactions is
needed to accelerate the design of effective TF-based
interventions to relieve neuron-intrinsic constraints to
regeneration and to foster recovery from CNS injury.},
