 abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) act as powerful levers to regulate
neural physiology and can be targeted to improve cellular
responses to injury or disease. Because TFs often depend on
cooperative activity, a major challenge is to identify and deploy
optimal sets. Here we developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline,
centered on TF co-occupancy of regulatory DNA, and used it to
predict factors that improve axon growth in corticospinal tract
(CST) axons when combined with a known pro-regenerative TF, Klf6.
Assays of neurite outgrowth confirmed cooperative activity by 12
candidates, and in vivo testing showed strong promotion of CST
growth upon combined expression of Klf6 and Nr5a2.
Transcriptional profiling of CST neurons identified
Klf6/Nr5a2-responsive gene networks involved in macromolecule
biosynthesis and DNA repair. These data identify novel TF
combinations that promote enhanced CST growth, clarify the
transcriptional correlates, and provide a bioinformatics roadmap
to detect TF synergy. ### Competing Interest Statement The
