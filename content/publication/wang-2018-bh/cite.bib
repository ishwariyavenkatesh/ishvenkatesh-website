 abstract = {The failure of axon regeneration in the CNS limits recovery from
damage and disease. Members of the KLF family of transcription
factors can exert both positive and negative effects on axon
regeneration, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we
show that forced expression of KLF6 promotes axon regeneration
by corticospinal tract neurons in the injured spinal cord. RNA
sequencing identified 454 genes whose expression changed upon
forced KLF6 expression in vitro, including sub-networks that
were highly enriched for functions relevant to axon extension
including cytoskeleton remodeling, lipid synthesis, and
bioenergetics. In addition, promoter analysis predicted a
functional interaction between KLF6 and a second transcription
factor, STAT3, and genome-wide footprinting using ATAC-Seq data
confirmed frequent co-occupancy. Co-expression of the two
factors yielded a synergistic elevation of neurite growth in
vitro. These data clarify the transcriptional control of axon
growth and point the way toward novel interventions to promote
CNS regeneration.},
