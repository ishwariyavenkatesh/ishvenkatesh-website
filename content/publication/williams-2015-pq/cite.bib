 abstract = {Unlike CNS neurons in adult mammals, neurons in fish and
embryonic mammals can regenerate their axons after injury. These
divergent regenerative responses are in part mediated by the
growth-associated expression of select transcription factors. The
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, MASH1/Ascl1a,
is transiently expressed during the development of many neuronal
subtypes and regulates the expression of genes that mediate cell
fate determination and differentiation. In the adult zebrafish
(Danio rerio), Ascl1a is also transiently expressed in retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) that regenerate axons after optic nerve
crush. Utilizing transgenic zebrafish with a 3.6 kb GAP43
promoter that drives expression of an enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP), we observed that knock-down of Ascl1a expression
reduces both regenerative gap43 gene expression and axonal growth
after injury compared to controls. In mammals, the development of
noradrenergic brainstem neurons requires MASH1 expression. In
contrast to zebrafish RGCs, however, MASH1 is not expressed in
the mammalian brainstem after spinal cord injury (SCI).
Therefore, we utilized adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to
overexpress MASH1 in four month old rat (Rattus norvegicus)
brainstem neurons in an attempt to promote axon regeneration
after SCI. We discovered that after complete transection of the
thoracic spinal cord and implantation of a Schwann cell bridge,
animals that express MASH1 exhibit increased noradrenergic axon
regeneration and improvement in hindlimb joint movements compared
to controls. Together these data demonstrate that MASH1/Ascl1a is
a fundamental regulator of axonal growth across vertebrates and
can induce modifications to the intrinsic state of neurons to
promote functional regeneration in response to CNS injury.},
